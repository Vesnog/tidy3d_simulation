This is the repository containing my simulation scripts using the Tidy3D. Tidy3D is available through FlexCompute on <a href="https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/solver/"> this website. </a>
Tidy3D is highly optimized and the simulation are run on the cloud using GPUs leading to faster simulation times. 

## Details:
 - The tutorial scripts are based on the FDTD tutorial available at https://www.flexcompute.com/fdtd101/
 - The plasmonic nanoslit simulation is based on the article T. Tanemura, P. Wahl, S. Fan and D. A. B. Miller, "Modal Source Radiator Model for Arbitrary Two-Dimensional Arrays of Subwavelength Apertures on Metal Films," in *IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics*, vol. 19, no. 3, pp. 4601110-4601110, May-June 2013, Art no. 4601110, doi: 10.1109/JSTQE.2012.2229383.
