This is the repository containing my simulation scripts using the Tidy3D. Tidy3D is available through FlexCompute on <a href="https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/solver/"> this website. </a>
Tidy3D is highly optimized and the simulation are run on the cloud using GPUs leading to faster simulation times. 

## Details:
 - The tutorial scripts are based on the FDTD tutorial available at https://www.flexcompute.com/fdtd101/
